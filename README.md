# Electric Vehicle Population Forecasting using Random Forest

## 📌 Overview

This project predicts the future population of Electric Vehicles (EVs) using historical EV registration data and Machine Learning. A Random Forest Regressor is trained on the dataset after preprocessing and feature engineering to forecast EV population trends.

The project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and model serialization.

## 📈 Machine Learning Model

Algorithm Used:

- Random Forest Regressor

Evaluation metrics include:

- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score
